# Climbing Stairs

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs)!

### [Solution]: Dynamic Programming

```python
def memoization(func):
    memo = {}

    def helper(self, x):
        if x not in memo:
            memo[x] = func(self, x)
        return memo[x]
    return helper


class Solution:
    @memoization
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 2
        else:
            return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)
```

Explanation: Basically, it is a Fibonacci sequence. I just use memoization to optimize time complexity.

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n), where n is value of steps to climb.

### Learning Keys:
- I knew it was a *Fibonacci sequence*, so I knew I had to use *recursion*. But, I didn't know how to *optimize* it within the code.
- Realizing it's a dynamic programming problem, I was confused how to work on it since this is my first DP program
- Discovered Python *Decorators*, decorating function with another function. Need to review this again in the future.
