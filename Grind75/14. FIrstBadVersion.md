# First Bad Version

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version)!

```python
# The isBadVersion API is defined as followed
def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:
    ...
```

### [Solution]()

```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        start, end = 1, n
        while start <= end:
            middle = (start + end) // 2

            if isBadVersion(middle) and not (isBadVersion(middle-1)):
                return middle
            elif isBadVersion(middle):
                end = middle - 1
            else:
                start = middle + 1

            
```

Time Complexity: O(logn), Space Complexity: O(1)

### Learning Keys:
- Since I recognized this kind of pattern from previous problems, I could solve it easily and under 5 mins
- This problem suggested me to minimize the API call, and need to **search** first bad version â€” so this directly leads me to Binary Search
