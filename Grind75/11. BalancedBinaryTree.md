# Balanced Binary Tree

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree)!

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### [Solution]: DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def findHeight(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:    
            #base case
            if root is None:
                return 0

            #iteration
            left_height = findHeight(root.left)
            right_height = findHeight(root.right)
            if left_height == -1 or right_height == -1 or abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:
                return -1
            return max(left_height, right_height) + 1
        return findHeight(root) != -1
```

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(h) for the recursive stack, where h is the height of the binary tree. In worst case, h will be n for an unbalanced binary tree.
