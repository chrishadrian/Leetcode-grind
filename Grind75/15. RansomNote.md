# Ransom Note

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note)!

### [Solution]: Hash Table

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        memo = {}

        for letter in magazine:
            if letter in memo:
                memo[letter] += 1
            else:
                memo[letter] = 1
        
        for letter in ransomNote:
            if letter not in memo or memo[letter] == 0:
                return False
            else:
                memo[letter] -= 1
            
        return True
```

Time Complexity: O(n+m), Space Complexity: O(1), where n is the length of ransomNote and m is the length of magazine.
