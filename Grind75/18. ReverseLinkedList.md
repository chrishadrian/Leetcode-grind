# Reverse Linked List

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)!

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### [Solution(1)] Recursive

```python
def reverseList(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head

    # Recursively reverse the rest of the linked list
    new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)

    # Reverse the current node
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = None

    return new_head
```

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)

### [Solution(2)] Iterative

```python
def reverseList(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    curr = head
    prev = None

    while curr is not None:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node

    return prev
```

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)

### Learning Keys:
- Recall how pointer works in linkedlist
- Iterate uses 3 pointers: prev, curr, next
- Recursive starts reversing from the end of the list
