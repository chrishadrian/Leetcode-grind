# Linked List Cycle

Problem can be found in [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)!

### [Solution(1)]: Fast Slow Pointers (Preferred)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

def hasCycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    fast_pointer = slow_pointer = head

    while fast_pointer and fast_pointer.next:
        fast_pointer, slow_pointer = fast_pointer.next.next, slow_pointer.next
        if fast_pointer == slow_pointer:
            return True

    return False
```

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)

### [Solution(2)]: Dictionary

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        memo = {}

        ptr = head
        index = 0

        while ptr:
            if ptr in memo:
                return True

            memo[ptr] = index
            index += 1
            ptr = ptr.next
        
        return False
```

Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)

### Learning Keys:
- Cycle problems is best to be solved with fast and slow pointers
- Dictionary sometimes has disadvantage on space complexity
